Mastra is a framework for building AI-powered applications and agents with a modern TypeScript stack. It includes everything you need to go from early prototypes to production-ready applications. Mastra integrates with frontend and backend frameworks like React, Next.js, and Node, or you can deploy it anywhere as a standalone server. It's the easiest way to build, tune, and scale reliable AI products.

Some of its highlights include: Model routing, agents, workflows, human-in-the-loop, context management, and MCP.

The documentation is organized into key sections:

- **Docs**: Core documentation covering concepts, features, and implementation details
- **Models**: Mastra provides a unified interface for working with LLMs across multiple providers
- **Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials for building specific applications
- **Reference**: API reference documentation

Each section contains detailed docs that provide comprehensive information about Mastra's features and how to use them effectively.

These are the most popular starting points:

- [Get Started with Mastra](https://mastra.ai/docs): Create a new project with the \`create mastra\` CLI or use one of the framework quickstart guides
- [Agent Overview](https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/overview): Agents use LLMs and tools to solve open-ended tasks. They reason about goals, decide which tools to use, retain conversation memory, and iterate internally until the model emits a final answer or an optional stop condition is met.
- [Workflows Overview](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/overview): Workflows let you define complex sequences of tasks using clear, structured steps rather than relying on the reasoning of a single agent.
- [Memory Overview](https://mastra.ai/docs/memory/overview): Memory gives your agent coherence across interactions and allows it to improve over time by retaining relevant information from past conversations.`
