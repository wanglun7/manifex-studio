Unless user explicitly asks do not inspect reference or modify examples
Prefer most specific AGENTS.md for changed area
For work in packages read package local packages/<name>/AGENTS.md first

turborepo pnpm workspace
packages use strict TypeScript
vitest tests are colocated with source
When you need to add a model name or ID to examples, changesets, tests, or comments, use one of the placeholder tokens from docs/src/plugins/remark-model-tokens/models.ts

Prefer narrowest build test lint typecheck for packages
when package splits unit integration or E2E coverage run narrowest suite first
From root prefer specific scripts like pnpm build:core or pnpm --filter ./packages/name script
Do not pnpm run setup pnpm build pnpm build:packages or repo wide test runs when package local is enough
Building whole monorepo is slow and should be last resort
Before pushing commits or opening PRs run the narrowest relevant local checks; if CodeRabbit CLI is installed and configured, run a local CodeRabbit review too
some integration tests need pnpm i --ignore-workspace

features and new packages need related docs updates
Follow docs/AGENTS.md and docs/styleguides when editing docs

After code changes follow @.mastracode/commands/changeset.md
