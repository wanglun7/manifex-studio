# CSV to Questions Generator

An agent that takes a CSV file as input, generates an AI summary to compress the data, and then produces focused questions based on that summary. Built with [Mastra](https://mastra.ai).

## Why we built this

This template demonstrates how to handle large datasets without hitting token limits by using a large context window model as a summarization layer before question generation.

This template shows how to combine agents into a workflow that can process large CSV files, generate summaries, and produce questions—all while keeping token usage efficient and costs down.

This demo runs in Mastra Studio, but you can connect this agent to your React, Next.js, or Vue app using the [Mastra Client SDK](https://mastra.ai/docs/server/mastra-client) or agentic UI libraries like [AI SDK UI](https://mastra.ai/guides/build-your-ui/ai-sdk-ui), [CopilotKit](https://mastra.ai/guides/build-your-ui/copilotkit), or [Assistant UI](https://mastra.ai/guides/build-your-ui/assistant-ui).

## Features

- **Token Limit Protection**: Uses AI summarization to compress large CSV datasets, preventing token limit errors and reducing costs.
- **Large Context Window**: Leverages `openai/gpt-5-mini` to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Data Analysis Focus**: Generates questions focused on patterns, insights, and practical applications of the data.

## Quick start

1. **Clone the template**
   - Run `npx create-mastra@latest --template csv-to-questions` to scaffold the project locally.
2. **Add your API key**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your OpenAI API key.
3. **Start the dev server**
   - Run `npm run dev` and open [localhost:4111](http://localhost:4111) to try it out.

Open Studio and navigate to the `csv-to-questions` workflow. Enter a CSV URL and the workflow will generate questions based on the content.

## Making it yours

Swap in a different model, or wire the agent into your app using the [Mastra Client SDK](https://mastra.ai/docs/server/mastra-client). The agent, tools, and workflow are all in `src/` — edit them directly to fit your use case.

## About Mastra templates

[Mastra templates](https://mastra.ai/templates) are ready-to-use projects that show off what you can build — clone one, poke around, and make it yours. They live in the [Mastra monorepo](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra) and are automatically synced to standalone repositories for easier cloning.
